# Project: Guess Who game

This is a simple Guess Who game built with javascript.

## The problem

The aim of this project was to build the functionality of a Guess Who game with javascript. 
I have used arrays, objects and array methods to loop and filter through arrays, passing on arguments between functions, and DOM selectors and event listeners to achieve functionality.
Next step would be to exchange the array objects (the persons) to any other kind of game characters and expand the list of possible questions in the select form. I would also change the styling.
